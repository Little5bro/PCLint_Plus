Release notes for PC-lint Plus Version 1.2

=== Product Changes ===
See Chapter 17 (Revision History) of the Reference Manual in the doc/
directory for a comprehensive list of changes.

See section 17.1 for a list of changes since Version 1.1.


=== Getting Started ===
See Chapter 2 for installation and configuration instructions. 


=== Binaries ===
Two binaries are provided for each supported operating system: a
production build and a build with debugging features enabled that
contains a '_debug' suffix.  The production build is faster but does
not report internal errors and cannot produce some of the detailed
information we may request when a bug report is submitted.

When submitting issues to technical support, please provide the
complete output that results from using the debug binary.
